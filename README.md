# TensorFlow2.0-Models

Semester 4 Project: Creating and Exporting TensorFlow2.0 Models for Sentiment Analysis

## Models Created

1. ANN for Sentiment Analysis: This is an example from documentation but I have also added eager execution model that can be trained with ``tf.GradientTape()`` and ``tf.function``.

2. RNN for Sentiment Analysis: This is also an example from documentation with eager executions models.

3. CNN for Sentiment Analysis: This is very much a WIP.

Please refer to the project documentation [here](docs/) for more information of the created models.
